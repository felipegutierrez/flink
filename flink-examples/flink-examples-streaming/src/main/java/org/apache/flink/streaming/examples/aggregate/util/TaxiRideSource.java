/**
 * This SourceFunction generates a data stream of TaxiRide records which are
 * read from a gzipped input file. Each record has a time stamp and the input file must be
 * ordered by this time stamp.
 * <p>
 * In order to simulate a realistic stream source, the SourceFunction serves events proportional to
 * their timestamps. In addition, the serving of events can be delayed by a bounded random delay
 * which causes the events to be served slightly out-of-order of their timestamps.
 * <p>
 * The serving speed of the SourceFunction can be adjusted by a serving speed factor.
 * A factor of 60.0 increases the logical serving time by a factor of 60, i.e., events of one
 * minute (60 seconds) are served in 1 second.
 * <p>
 * This SourceFunction is an EventSourceFunction and does continuously emit watermarks.
 * Hence it is able to operate in event time mode which is configured as follows:
 * <p>
 * StreamExecutionEnvironment.setStreamTimeCharacteristic(TimeCharacteristic.EventTime)
